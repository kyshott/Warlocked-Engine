  # **Warlocked Engine**
  ## Made using SDL2, Tiled (tinytmx) and CMake w/ the Ninja build system.

  ### Current Features
  - Tiled map (.tmx) import and rendering support thanks to tinytmx. Supports multi-layer maps and embedded tilesets.
  - Zelda-esque map chunking and loading with managed memory and state for each area.
  - Controllable player entities with custom SDL event key stack to mimic D-Pad input restrictions.

  **and many more to come...**
